# pw-datadriver-ex
This is a small simple playwright/typescript test project where there's a single test that loops over a testData array.
To run you'll first need to install the following:
vscode - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Nodejs - https://nodejs.org/en/download
Here is a good video that walks thru the setup of Playwright Extension inside vscode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz6lhEzgI5I
Each time I clone this repo, I need to bring up the command palette (Ctl-Shift-P) and run Install Playwright. Once I do this I should be able to go to the Testing tab and run these tests.
